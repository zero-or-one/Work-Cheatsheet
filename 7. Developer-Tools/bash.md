### 2. **`cd`** – Change Directory

Changes the current working directory to the specified path.

```bash
cd /home/user/Documents    # Navigates to Documents folder
cd ..                      # Moves up one directory level

```

### 4. **`cp`** – Copy Files or Directories

Copies files or directories from one location to another.

```bash
cp file1.txt /path/to/destination/         # Copies a file

```

### 5. **`mv`** – Move or Rename Files/Directories

### 6. **`rm`** – Remove Files or Directories

Deletes files or directories.

```bash
rm file.txt            # Deletes a file
rm -r folder/          # Deletes a directory and its contents recursively

### 9. **`grep`** – Search for Patterns in Files

```bash
grep "keyword" file.txt                # Searches for 'keyword' in a file

```

---

### 10. **`chmod`** – Change File Permissions

Modifies the access permissions of a file or directory.

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh                   # Assigns read, write, and execute permissions to owner; read & execute to others
chmod +x script.sh                    # Adds execute permission to the file
chmod -r file.txt                     # Removes read permission
```

**Common Modes:**
