# General Information

## Words and Sounds

- **Phoneme**: the smallest unit of sound in speech that distinguishes meaning (e.g., /p/ in "pat").
- **Grapheme** or **character**: the smallest unit of written language, such as letters or symbols (e.g., "a" or "ä½ ").
- **Syllable**: a unit of sound formed by one or more phonemes, typically containing a vowel sound, that forms a part of a word (e.g., "com" and "put" in "computer").

## Other Basic Terms

- **Morpheme**: the smallest meaningful unit of language (e.g., "un-", "break", "-able").
- **Token**: an instance of a sequence of characters in text, often the output of tokenization (e.g., "computer", "!", "123").
- **Lemma**: the canonical dictionary form of a word (e.g., "run" is the lemma for "runs", "running").
- **Lexeme**: a set of all inflected forms of a single word, representing a unit of meaning (e.g., {run, runs, ran, running}).
- **n-gram**: a contiguous sequence of _n_ items (letters, words) from a given text (e.g., bigram: "natural language").
- **Corpus**: a large collection of structured text used for linguistic analysis and model training.
- **Embedding**: a vector representation of discrete units (words, tokens) capturing semantic relationships in continuous space.
