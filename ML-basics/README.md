# Machine Learning Basics

This directory contains fundamental concepts, techniques, and best practices in Machine Learning.

## Contents

### Model Architecture

- [Large Model Types](large-models-types.md)
  - Model Directionality: How models process sequential data - either in one direction (unidirectional) or both directions (bidirectional)
  - Regression Types: Different approaches to sequence prediction - either using past values (autoregression) or predicting all at once

### Basic ML Concepts [See concepts.md]

- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning: Learning with labeled data vs discovering patterns in unlabeled data
- Classification vs Regression: Predicting categories vs continuous values
- Training, Validation, Test Sets: Different dataset splits used to train and evaluate models

### Model Evaluation [See evaluation.md]

- Metrics and KPIs: Various measures to assess model performance
- Cross-validation: Techniques to ensure robust model evaluation
- Overfitting/Underfitting: Common model training issues and how to address them

### Optimization [See optimization.md]

- Loss Functions: Different ways to measure model error
- Gradient Descent: Core algorithm for optimizing neural networks
- Learning Rate & Momentum: Key parameters that control model training

### Neural Networks [See neural_networks.md]

- Activation Functions: Non-linear functions that enable complex pattern learning
- Backpropagation: Algorithm for training neural networks
- Network Architectures: Different ways to structure neural networks
